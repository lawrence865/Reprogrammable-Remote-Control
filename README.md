# Reprogrammable-Remote-Control

OVERVIEW:
This project is a custom, reprogrammable remote controller built around an Arduino microcontroller. The device features two joysticks and two buttons, similar in layout to a controller, and can communicate with other systems using either RF24 wireless radio or serial communication. 
The goal of this project was to create a versatile, reusable controller that could be used to operate multiple future projects (e.g., robots, vehicles, games) without needing to redesign a new control interface each time.
The controller is fully self-contained with built-in batteries, a custom 3D-printed enclosure, and integrated electronics and circuits. 
Project fully coded with C++ in the Arduino IDE. 

FEATURES AND COMPONENTS: 
- Dual-joystick control (X and Y axes on both sticks)
- Two push buttons
- RF24 wireless communication for remote control NRF24L01 radio
- Serial communication option for wired use
- LED indicator for power status
- Power switch and integrated rechargeable battery system
- Custom 3D-printed enclosure designed in SolidWorks
- Microcontroller: Arduino Nano

TASKS:
- Designed the enclosure and internal component layout in SolidWorks
- Iterated through multiple 3D-printed versions to improve fit, ergonomics, and durability
- Designed, wired, and soldered the circuit independently

APPLICATION:
- I have designed a remote controlled car that was paired with this remote.
- I wish to program a two player interative real-time game that could be played with the remotes.
